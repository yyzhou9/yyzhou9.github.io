  - title: STM study of moiré graphene and TMDC materials
    company: Visiting Student Researcher supervised by Prof. Michael Crommie
    company_url: 'https://crommie.berkeley.edu/'
    location: Crommie Group, UC Berkeley
    date_start: '2021-09-01'
    date_end: '2022-01-04'
    description: |2-
        * Characterized twisted bilayer graphene and TMDC devices ($TaSe_{2}$, $NbSe_{2}$, $TaTe_{2}$, etc.). Studied the evolution of electronic structures with back gate.
        * Imaged the Mott insulating behavior of monolayer 1T-$TaSe_{2}$ with ‘flower pattern’ orbital texture.

  - title: Unconventional superconductivity in oxides   
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: 'https://phyai.fudan.edu.cn/yjcg/list.htm'
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2019-05-01'
    date_end: '2021-08-20'
    description: |2-
        * Grew and optimized single crystal oxide thin films $Ti_{2}O_{3}/GaN$ with pulsed-laser deposition.
        * Studied the nontrivial topology of rare-earth oxide superconductor LaO with first-principle calculation.
        * Analyzed the energy splitting of La orbitals in oxygen octahedron crystal fields with group theory.

  - title: CVD growth of 2D materials and device fabrication
    company: Supervised by Prof. Faxian Xiu
    company_url: 'http://www.physics.fudan.edu.cn/tps/people/fxxiu/'
    location: Nanodevice Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2018-11-01'
    date_end: '2019-05-01'
    description: |2-
        * Synthesized high quality $Bi_{2}SeO_{2}$ sample using chemical vapor deposition method (CVD)
        * Peeled off single-layered graphene for heterostructure fabrication.
